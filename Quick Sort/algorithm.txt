Step 1 − Choose the highest index value has pivot

Step 2 − Take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding pivot

Step 3 − left points to the low index

Step 4 − right points to the high

Step 5 − while value at left is less than pivot move right

Step 6 − while value at right is greater than pivot move left

Step 7 − if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right

Step 8 − if left ≥ right, the point where they met is new pivot
